A system for managing shared office, meeting, laboratory, and teaching space is to be developed. A networked display appliance is situated outside each room. The appliance indicates who has reserved the space and for what period. The appliance allows users to reserve a room and check the availability of other rooms. The system is a web based scheduling system but the status of each room can be checked at location. It incorporates the use of small flat panel displays to eliminate scheduling conflicts, interruptions, and encourage better space utilization.
All the room displays are networked so then can be accessed via a web interface (a single URL). Every roomâ€™s schedule can viewed from the web interface and maintained by an administrator. A user should be able to check the availability of any room from the room display and the web interface. The web interface allows for reserving rooms along with searching tools to find available rooms.
